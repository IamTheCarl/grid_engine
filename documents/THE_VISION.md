# The Vision for Grid Locked
There's now a small following for this project on Discord, and they want to know what my goals for this project are; So I'm doing my best to document those here. I'll try to portray my goals without going too deep into the technical details or plan.

Grid Locked is planned to be feel familiar to Minecraft. It is certainly of the same genre, but definitely not a clone.

My hope for Grid Locked is to make it to Minecraft what Half-Life was to the FPS genre. Prior to the release of Half-Life, games focused in large part on mechanics originally popularized in Doom. Half-Life was the first to focus on telling a story, and added many key features and mechanics to the FPS genre that still exist in many games to this day.

Grid Locked hopes to tell a story as well, in a way consistent with player-driven discovery. You have to wander the world and explore to find the story. Unearth ruins, crack codes, follow clues, and even go to space to find the secrets of a lost civilization. This is no small task, as you must cover a lot of ground, and a space ship is very expensive. You will need to build factories and automation to help you on your way, and some robotic friends will certainly be of use. Let's not forget that the things which killed off this civilization still roam the planet. You'll need to keep yourself well defended, and be cautious of the strange things you discover.

## The Community

Community is first and foremost in the design of this game. I want fan works. I want a ton of them. As a result, character design needs to be appealing and fun to draw. Characters also need to be decent bases for fan fiction (I really hope I don't regret that.) A community of such fan works will need positive reinforcements, avoiding rude or negative interations but giving valuable critique and having fun, which means moderation on some level.

Although Grid Locked is meant to be a very technical game, it will need to have some aspects of it that can be enjoyed by non-technical people. Combat and exploration will hopefully fill in for this.

## Modding

Grid Locked will be moddable, and suited for a large modding community. The modding API is focused on speed and consistency, as we don't want mods that are slow or crash often, and that may lead to some complication in usage.

## Multi Player

I would like for this game to be able to support a massive multiplayer base, enabling up to 50 players on an ordinary server at once. That's no easy feat. A player's role on the server will depend mostly on what they equip. While you can make yourself a generic "jack of all trades", you'd be wise to instead fill a role for your friends, while they fill in other roles. For example, even though anyone can heal, if you give up your weapon to carry better medical equipment, you can be an amazing healer.

## Crafting

No crafting grids are planned. They play poorly with mods and it's just too iconic to Minecraft, in my opinion. Instead my plan is to actually require the player physically move things around in the world to craft. You can assemble things in your inventory (put parts together) but if you need to mill a part, you'll have an in-world machine you must use to do the job. This will require you to build a fairly large workshop, and also is a good incentive to automate the production of common parts. All crafting recipes are reversible, enabling you to get materials back. But... the amount of material you get back will vary.

## Research and Development

I don't want the game to completely hold your hand the whole time. I think it's fun to have to experiment and discover. To unlock tech you must do research and development, which should help you to learn the base technologies that higher technologies depend on. You'll have to complete some challenges in some cases. In others, taking pictures of machines and products of your factories will count toward your research. You can also gain a lot of research by exploring ruins, but that's completely optional.

(Joel Note 1: I believe we should have materials have consistent properties to allow for real layering and understanding to emerge as with real science. We should have a game loop of roughly:

Observation: My toaster doesn’t work. ( I'm dying often )
Question: Is something wrong with my electrical outlet? ( How can I improve against these challenges? )
Hypothesis: If something is wrong with the outlet, my coffeemaker also won’t work when plugged into it. ( 
Experiment: I plug my coffeemaker into the outlet.
Result: My coffeemaker works!
Conclusion: My electrical outlet works, but my toaster still won’t toast my bread.
Refine the hypothesis: My toaster is broken.
(End Edit Proccess Day 1)
## Economy

There is a plan for an in-game economy. No I will not charge real money for the in-game money. What do you think this is? A pay to play? In-game  money can be used as a way to obtain tech you have not yet unlocked, or to traid with other players. Server admins can also use it to make up for balance issues in resource generation.

## Bioms

In comparison to Minecraft, I want bioms to be massive. The reason for this is to help motivate the player to build logistics and transport systems, such as trains.

## Death

You can die in the game. When it happens, your body will be left where it was, and all materials and consumables will be left in it, unless of course you play in-game currency to get it back. Tools will stay with you when you respawn, however I'm willing to make a setting to disable that behavior in PVP servers.

## Vehicles

Fully mobile vehicles made of blocks are a big goal of this project. They will range from trains to space ships. I am uncertain at this time if I will be able to find a practical way to make water fit into this world, so I am uncertain if watercraft will ever be a thing.

## Combat

Combat will vary by biome, as the biom determines what kind of enemies will span. Enemies generally do not respawn, but rather reproduce. Because of this, if you clean out a mine, it will likely stay clean. But if you leave a survivor, he will reproduce and that mine will eventually be infested once more. This means you don't need to worry so much about filling your own base with lights, but more about just keeping it clean and them out.

Because enemies generally don't spawn at random, occasional assault teams will be spawned to harass your base, just to give you a reason to keep your defenses up.

The combat style of the game will vary from biome to biome. While some will give you a more Quake like experience, franticly fighting off hordes, others will spawn few enemies that are very tanky. If you know where you're going, you'll know to arm yourself for the enemies you're going to find there. This game rewards you well for forethought.

## Ruins

A ruin will typically be a run down and destroyed place, with little of use. But they'll generally be scenic. But some ruins are fortresses, and those get much more interesting.

Fortresses often cannot be destructed until you research the civilization enough to know how to break their strongest materials. If you are in a PVP server, you can use this to your advantage. Research a civilization's materials and then make it hard for your enemies to find research material on that civilization. You can make your own fortress much more resistant to them.

A fortress is also often filled to the brim with enemies unique to that civilization, and will also contain a boss. Until you defeat the boss, every time you leave the area, enemies will respawn.

## Resources

While you can find ore scattered throughout the world in block form, this will not be your primary means of obtaining material. It's most useful as an early game way of obtaining ore, and it will still be a useful way to obtain ore in late game if you research the right topics. But your main means of obtaining ore will be through mining vents. Deep in the surface of the planet are vents that spew molten material that can be useful for you. You'll need to find a way to harvest it and then get it up to the surface for processing, or maybe you can just process it right there underground. Get clever about it. Vents never fully run out of material, but they do slow down their output over time. You can also find resource stashes in ruins.
